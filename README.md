Recommendations

1Ô∏è‚É£ It was evident that Maharashtra wasn't taking the covid-19 safety measures seriously as they had the highest number of cases. My advice is that they should take safety into consideration first
2Ô∏è‚É£ I also recommend that those who took the first dose of vaccines should endeavour to take the second dose so as to prevent it as prevention is better than cure
